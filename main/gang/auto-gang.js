/*

A 'cycle' lasts 5 minutes and the current task for any given member on a cycle
is set by taking the cycle and their member index and modding by the number
of tasks in your list, so it should spread out tasks evenly among your members,
and each one should progress through the list of tasks, although when you start
only the first member will start on task 0.

Set 'upgradeEquipmentNames' to a list of the gear you want to purchase,
currently it gets a list of all equipment by type and includes all types.



Jobs are:
 [
  "Unassigned",
  "Mug People",
  "Deal Drugs",
  "Strongarm Civilians",
  "Run a Con",
  "Armed Robbery",
  "Traffick Illegal Arms",
  "Threaten & Blackmail",
  "Human Trafficking",
  "Terrorism",
  "Vigilante Justice",
  "Train Combat",
  "Train Hacking",
  "Train Charisma",
  "Territory Warfare"
]
